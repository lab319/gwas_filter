# gwas_filter

<font size=8>**The *gwas_filter* is an R script that can efficiently and accurately filter genome-wide association studies (GWASs) from the GWAS Catalog Website. It takes six steps for gwasfilter.R to filter GWASs. There are five main self-defined functions among this R script. GWASs can be filtered on the basis of “whether the GWAS has been replicated”, “sample size”, “ethnicity of the study population” and other conditions. It takes no more than 1 second for this script to filter GWASs of a single trait.**
